        <P>We sell quality clothing, shoes and accessories.
             We sell the items on your behalf. You get 50% of the sale price. 
             Simple as that.</P>
        <P>In store you’ll find a variety of designer, vintage and quality high street brands. 
            We carefully accept well-made pieces based on quality, condition, style, and season, 
            as well as what we see selling in store. As a general rule,
             if you wouldn’t give it to a friend, we probably won’t be able to take it either!</P>

        <h3>CLOTHING CRITERIA</h3>
        <P>We accept well-made items based on quality, condition, and what we see selling in store. 
            <strong>If your pieces match ALL of the criteria below, you’ll have a good chance of having your
             drop accepted.</strong> If you are dropping off in store we must be able to accept a minimum of 
             5 items, or 10 if we are picking up from you. So 
            it pays to include a few extra pieces in case some items don't meet our criteria.</P> 
        <ul>
            <li>Well-made pieces that are designed to last</li>
            <li>Great condition</li>
            <li>Freshly laundered</li>
            <li>Matches the current season</li>
            <li>Current or timeless styles</li>
            <li>Clothing, shoes and accessories only</li>

        <h3>SELLING INFORMATION</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="selldetail">All accepted clothing moves through an 8 week cycle; 4 weeks at full
                 price, 2 weeks at 25% off, 2 weeks at 50% off. If unsold after this 
                 time your clothing will become the property of the store and be recycled
                  responsibly through our Donation Program which supports a number of 
                  organisations.</li>
            <li id="selldetail"> If you opt to collect unaccepted items, this must be done within 7 days 
                of the processing date after which they will be recycled through our Donation 
                Program.</li>
            <li id="selldetail">Once sold, you receive 50% of the sale price minus GST. Payments $100 and under
                 can be collected in store via eftpos refund or cash, or for payments over $100 
                 you can request a bank transfer through your online account. Or, use your 
                 balance as store credit!</li>
            <li id="selldetail">You can easily track the progress of your items through your online account. 
                Your clothing will expire after 8 weeks, become property of the company and 
                be recycled through our Donation Program, but you are welcome to find and 
                collect your pieces anytime before this. </li>
